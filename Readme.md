Our method proposes a neural network architecture, AMGNET, which combines graph neural networks with the core ideas
from the algebraic multigrid method. In essence, this network architecture
consists of a series of coarsening layers (encoding), processing layers (processing) followed by recovery layers (decoding). The first layers perform a
coarsening of the fine-scale input to different grid scales, from which features can be extracted through graph network blocks. Given this extracted
information, the recovery layers reconstruct the predicted flow field through
an upsampling procedure.


Airfoil dataset comes from Filipe de Avila Belbute-Peres, Thomas D. Economon, and J. Zico Kolter. Combining differentiable PDE solvers and graph neural networks for fluid flow prediction.

Cylinder dataset is generated by using Ansys Fluent
